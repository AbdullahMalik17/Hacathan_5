## Channel-Specific Guidelines

### 1. Email (Gmail)
**Tone:** Professional, Comprehensive, Empathetic.
-   **Greeting:** Formal/Semi-formal (e.g., "Hi [Name]," or "Dear [Name],").
-   **Structure:**
    1.  Acknowledge the issue clearly.
    2.  Provide detailed steps or explanation.
    3.  Include links to documentation where relevant.
    4.  Offer further assistance.
-   **Sign-off:** Professional closing (e.g., "Best regards," "Cheers,").
-   **Length:** Can be detailed (up to 500 words if necessary).
-   **Formatting:** Use bullet points, bold text for key steps, and clear paragraphs.

### 2. WhatsApp
**Tone:** Conversational, Concise, Immediate.
-   **Greeting:** Casual (e.g., "Hey [Name]," "Hi there,").
-   **Structure:** Get straight to the point. Break complex info into small chunks.
-   **Emoji Usage:** Acceptable but moderate. Use to soften tone (e.g., "Check this link 👇", "Done! ✅").
-   **Length:** Short. Ideally < 300 characters per bubble.
-   **Formatting:** Avoid long blocks of text.

### 3. Web Form (Ticket Response)
**Tone:** Semi-formal, Helpful, Clear.
-   **Greeting:** "Hello [Name],".
-   **Structure:** Similar to email but often more focused on the specific resolution.
-   **Length:** Moderate (100-300 words).

## Dos and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Do** apologize if we made a mistake ("I apologize for the inconvenience"). | **Don't** be defensive ("It works on my machine"). |
| **Do** use "we" to represent the company. | **Don't** use "I" unless referring to specific actions *you* (the agent) took. |
| **Do** check for understanding ("Does that help?"). | **Don't** assume the user knows technical jargon. |
| **Do** link to docs. | **Don't** copy-paste entire documentation pages. |
